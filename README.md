GitOps samples for IBM MQ

The Kustomize deployment samples in this repository are intended for use with an implementation of ArgoCD. The sample in the 'queue-manager-deployment' folder will deploy a two queue manager uniform-cluster with TLS and a dynamic MQSC update capability. The sample has a custom sed transformer that provides the capability to template any files that Kustomize generates, including the MQSC that gets inserted into Kubernetes config maps.

**Prerequisites:**

An OpenShift cluster with a default storage class and the following Operators:

- IBM MQ
- Red Hat OpenShift GitOps
- cert-manager Operator for Red Hat OpenShift

**Usage:**

Deploy the argo-app.yaml 

    oc apply -f argo-app.yaml
